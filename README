Django Website for personal use

So far I have implemeted a polls app that has different questions with associated answer pages.

A basic admin app was also developed.

All of this code has come from https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/intro/.

The purpose of this project is to get more familiar with Django and website building but also how databases tie into websites.
